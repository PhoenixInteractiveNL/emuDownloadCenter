[emu:ccs64]
name=CCS64
Notes=CCS64 is a Commodore 64 Emulator for PC and also in the future other platforms. It was developed by me, Per Håkan Sundell, as my Master Thesis at my university in 1995 and have been expanded a lot since then. My personal  interest in the C64 has been very intensive since 1983 when I was spending nearly all my time with it, and I was deeply involved in the so called 'Scene'. When I later in 1987 bought my Amiga 500, I missed the old good times I had with my C64 and since then I have tried my very best to make all the old programs to work on my new machines.

[emu:yape]
name=Yet Another Plus/4 Emulator
Notes=YAPE is a Commodore 264 family emulator. It's an 8-bit microcomputer family from the once-great-now-defunct Commodore Business Machines Ltd. They were released as a successor to the immensely popular Commodore 64 supposedly to either compete with the ZX Spectrum or other micros but eventually failed to gain market success and the whole line was dumped within a couple of years. However they were hugely popular in a few countries such as Hungary, Germany or Italy (to a certain extent also in the UK).
