[emu:calice]
name=Calice32
Notes=Calice is an emulator that is capable of playing almost all SNK Neo Geo ROMs plus, Sony ZiNc ZN1 and ZN2, Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 and all Sega System 16/18 ROMs. One of its cons is that it lacks image enhancements that Kawaks and Nebula have. It also requires that you run your desktop in 16 bit color rather than 32 bit.
